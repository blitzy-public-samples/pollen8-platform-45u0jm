File characteristics:
- Format: WOFF2 (Web Open Font Format 2.0)
- Weight: Regular
- Usage: Primary body text in the Pollen8 platform

This file is part of the font family used in the black and white minimalist interface design of the Pollen8 platform. It is typically loaded via a CSS @font-face declaration for optimized web font loading.

To use this font in the project:

1. Ensure this file is placed in the correct directory: src/frontend/src/assets/fonts/
2. Reference it in your CSS, typically in src/frontend/src/styles/index.css, using an @font-face declaration:

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Proxima Nova';
  src: url('../assets/fonts/ProximaNova-Regular.woff2') format('woff2');
  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
}

3. Use it in your Tailwind CSS configuration or directly in your styles:

font-family: 'Proxima Nova', sans-serif;

Performance considerations:
- WOFF2 format provides optimal compression for fast loading
- Consider preloading this font file for critical UI rendering
- Implement font subsetting if not all characters are needed to reduce file size

Accessibility impact:
- Chosen for excellent readability across different screen sizes
- Regular weight provides good contrast and legibility
- Part of the overall user-centric design approach

Remember to include appropriate licensing information for the Proxima Nova font in your project documentation.
