File characteristics:
- Type: Font file
- Format: WOFF2
- Font Family: Proxima Nova
- Font Weight: Light (300)

Usage in the project:
1. This font file is used to implement the minimalist, user-centric design of the Pollen8 platform.
2. It is specifically used for body text, secondary information, and UI elements requiring a lighter touch.
3. The font is registered for use in the application's CSS, likely in the file: src/frontend/src/styles/index.css

Technical considerations:
- WOFF2 is the most modern and efficient web font format.
- It is optimized for web use with minimal file size.
- This format is supported by all modern browsers.
- For optimal font loading performance, this file should be preloaded.

Implementation note:
To use this font in the application, ensure that it is properly referenced in the CSS using an @font-face declaration. For example:

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Proxima Nova';
  src: url('../assets/fonts/ProximaNova-Light.woff2') format('woff2');
  font-weight: 300;
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
}

Then, you can use it in your CSS as follows:

body {
  font-family: 'Proxima Nova', sans-serif;
  font-weight: 300;
  font-size: 14px;
}

Remember to adjust the relative path in the src URL according to your project structure.
