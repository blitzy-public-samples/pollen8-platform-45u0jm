## Overview

The Pollen8 platform utilizes MongoDB as the primary data store and Redis for caching. This combination provides a flexible, scalable, and high-performance data layer to support the platform's minimalist, data-driven approach.

## Architecture

### Data Stores

1. **Primary Database: MongoDB**
   - Purpose: Persistent data storage
   - Used for storing user profiles, connections, invites, and other core data

2. **Cache Layer: Redis**
   - Purpose: Performance optimization and real-time features
   - Used for caching frequently accessed data and supporting real-time functionality

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Repository Pattern**: We implement the repository pattern for data access abstraction. This allows for a clean separation between the data access logic and the business logic.

2. **Caching Strategies**: Various caching strategies are implemented to optimize performance and reduce database load.

3. **Strict Schema Validation**: To ensure data integrity, we enforce strict schema validation for all collections in MongoDB.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the database layer for development or deployment:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Run database migrations:
   ```
   npm run migrate
   ```

3. Seed initial data:
   ```
   npm run seed
   ```

## Data Models

### User
- Purpose: Store user information
- Key fields:
  - phoneNumber
  - industries
  - interests
  - location

### Connection
- Purpose: Track user connections
- Key fields:
  - userId
  - connectedUserId
  - connectedAt

### Invite
- Purpose: Manage invite links
- Key fields:
  - userId
  - code
  - clickCount

## Caching Strategy

1. **User Profile**
   - TTL: 1 hour
   - Use case: Frequently accessed user data

2. **Network Graph**
   - TTL: 15 minutes
   - Use case: Complex network calculations

## Monitoring

We use the following metrics to monitor database performance:

1. **Query Performance**
   - Tool: MongoDB Profiler
   - Threshold: < 100ms

2. **Cache Hit Rate**
   - Tool: Redis INFO
   - Threshold: > 80%

## Additional Notes

- The database layer is designed to support the platform's minimalist, data-driven approach.
- All data models include timestamps for auditing purposes.
- The architecture supports future scaling requirements.
- Regular backups are configured for data safety.
