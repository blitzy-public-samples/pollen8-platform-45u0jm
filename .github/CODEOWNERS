# This CODEOWNERS file uses a pattern-matching syntax to assign ownership.
# Multiple teams can be assigned as owners for the same pattern.
# More specific patterns take precedence over less specific ones.
# The file ensures that appropriate experts review changes to their domains.
# Security-critical components require review from the security team.
# The core team serves as a fallback for files not matching specific patterns.
# This setup aligns with the microservices architecture defined in the technical specification.
